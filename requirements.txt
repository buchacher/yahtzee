    they can enter a zero for any of them.

6.1 Note that some combination of dice can be used to make up different combinations.
6.2 Three fives can be scored as three fives in the upper section or as three of a kind in the lower section
    (together with the numbers on the remaining two dice).
6.3 The player can decide which scoring option to use.

7.1 The combinations in the upper section are added and if the total is 63 or more, the player gets a bonus of 35
    points.
7.2 63 is the number of points resulting from the player getting three of each kind in the upper section
    (63=3*1+3*2+3*3+3*4+3*5+3*6).
7.3 If they score fewer than three of a kind in for a number then they need to make up for it by scoring more for other
    numbers to make up the difference. For example, if they score only two threes then they can make up for it by
    scoring four fives.

8.1 The total score is the sum of the totals for the upper and lower sections.
